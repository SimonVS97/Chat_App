### Running the app

To begin running the app, open your terminal and run 'expo start' while in the root folder of the project (once downloaded from github). This will start a local server and give you a QR code.

Next, download Expo Go from the app store on your mobile device. Once downloaded, follow the steps to login/create an account and wait for the menu screen to load. Once it does, use the option 'Scan QR code' to scan the code your terminal displays. This will load the app. NOTE: your local machine and your phone must be on the same network to run the app this way.
